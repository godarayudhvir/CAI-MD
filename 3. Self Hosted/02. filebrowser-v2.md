```dockerfile
version: '1'
services:
  file-browser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser
    container_name: file-browser
    #uid and gid is 0 for root
    user: 0:0 #uid and gid
    ports:
      - 8081:80 #Web Gui Will be available on port 8081
    volumes:
      - /:/srv
      - /mnt/e/Media Libraries:/srv/public/
      - /mnt/e/Software:/srv/public/software
      - /mnt/d/filebrowser/branding:/branding
      - /mnt/d/filebrowser/filebrowser.db:/database.db
    restart: unless-stopped #Docker will restart on its own everytime it crashes
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
```

This is a Docker Compose file that defines a single service named `file-browser`. Hereâ€™s what each part does:

- `version: '1'`: This specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. Version 1 is the simplest and has the fewest features.

- `services:`: This is the section where you define your services. In this case, thereâ€™s just one service named `file-browser`.

- `image: filebrowser/filebrowser`: This tells Docker to use the `filebrowser/filebrowser` image from Docker Hub for this service.

- `container_name: file-browser`: This sets the name of the container to `file-browser`.

- `user: 0:0`: This sets the user and group IDs inside the container to 0, which corresponds to the root user.

- `ports: - 8081:80`: This maps port 80 inside the container to port 8081 on the host machine.

- `volumes:`: This section defines several volumes that map paths on the host machine to paths inside the container.

- `restart: unless-stopped`: This tells Docker to automatically restart the container if it crashes, unless it was manually stopped.

- `security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true`: This is a security option that prevents the container from gaining additional privileges.
  

Create a file "**filebrowser.db**" with "touch"

```bash
touch filebrowser.db
```

Run Docker compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This is the expected output
