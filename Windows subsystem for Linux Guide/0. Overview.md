The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

Historically, Windows has not been been the preferred OS for many people, but things have changed over the past couple years. Microsoft few years ago launched Windows Subsystem for Linux or WSL (WSL2), allowing us to install REAL linux distros (like Ubuntu) on Windows 10. 

## This means

1. You can Learn Linux and its more accessible than ever.
2. You can use Linux toolchains (bash, zsh, tmux) and apps to manage the file system and run windows apps.

People can access the power of both Windows and Linux at the same time on a Windows machine.
