to use the commands below. 
​

   The --install command performs the following actions:
   
   - Enables the option WSL and Virtual Machine Platform components
   - Downloads and installs the latest Linux kernel
   - Sets WSL 2 as the default [More on this later]
   - Downloads and installs the Ubuntu Linux distribution (reboot may be required)
   
   OR 
   
   You can also Specify the Linux distribution to install
   For a valid list of distribution names, run `wsl --list --online`.

Example `wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu-20.04`

Alternatively you can install Linux from MS Store as well

4. Set up your Linux user info

Once you are done with unix user account creation you will be logged into your user
and that's pretty much how you install Linux on Windows.

### Basic commands for WSL

The WSL commands below are listed in a format supported by PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt. To run these commands from a Bash / Linux distribution command line, you must replace wsl with wsl.exe. For a full list of commands, run `wsl --help`.

#### List available Linux distributions

`wsl --list --online`

#### List installed Linux distributions

`wsl --list --verbose`

#### #### Shutdown

`wsl --shutdown`

Immediately terminates all running distributions and the WSL 2 lightweight utility virtual machine. This command may be necessary in instances that require you to restart the WSL 2 virtual machine environment, such as changing memory usage limits or making a change to your .wslconfig file.

#### Terminate

[wsl --terminate <Distribution Name>]()

To terminate the specified distribution, or stop it from running, replace <Distribution Name> with the name of the targeted distribution.

## Unregister or uninstall a Linux distribution

While Linux distributions can be installed through the Microsoft Store, they can't be uninstalled through the store.

To unregister and uninstall a WSL distribution:

```
wsl --unregister <DistributionName>
```

Replacing `<DistributionName>` with the name of your targeted Linux distribution will unregister that distribution from WSL so it can be reinstalled or cleaned up. **Caution:** Once unregistered, all data, settings, and software associated with that distribution will be permanently lost. Reinstalling from the store will install a clean copy of the distribution. For example, `wsl --unregister Ubuntu` would remove Ubuntu from the distributions available in WSL. Running `wsl --list` will reveal that it is no longer listed.
