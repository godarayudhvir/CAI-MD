​
The primary differences between WSL 1 and WSL 2 are the use of an actual Linux kernel inside a managed VM, support for full system call compatibility, and performance across the Linux and Windows operating systems. WSL 2 is the current default version when installing a Linux distribution and uses the latest and greatest in virtualization technology to run a Linux kernel inside of a lightweight utility virtual machine (VM).
