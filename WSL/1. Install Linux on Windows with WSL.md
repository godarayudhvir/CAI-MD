## Prerequisites

You must be running **Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11** to use the commands below. 
​

## Install WSL

1. Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator"
   
   Enter the `wsl --install` command, then restart your machine.

   The --install command performs the following actions:
   
   - Enables the optional WSL and Virtual Machine Platform components
   - Downloads and installs the latest Linux kernel
   - Sets WSL 2 as the default [More on this later]
   - Downloads and installs the Ubuntu Linux distribution (reboot may be required)
   
   OR Go to Control Panel --> Programs --> Turn on Windows Feature on or off
   There enable Windows subsystem for Linux and then you will be prompted to restart, do so and come back. [This will install WSL 1]

You can also Specify the Linux distribution to install
For a valid list of distribution names, run `wsl --list --online`.

Example `wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu-20.04`

Alternatively you can install Linux from MS Store as well

​

3. You will find the downloaded linux distribution in start menu, Open it

4. Set up your Linux user info

Once you are done with unix user account creation you will be logged into your user
and that's pretty much how you install Linux on Windows.

### Basic commands for WSL

The WSL commands below are listed in a format supported by PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt. To run these commands from a Bash / Linux distribution command line, you must replace wsl with wsl.exe. For a full list of commands, run `wsl --help`.

#### List available Linux distributions

`wsl --list --online`

#### List installed Linux distributions

`wsl --list --verbose`

#### Set WSL version to 1 or 2

`wsl --set-version <distribution name> <versionNumber>`

To set a default version of WSL 1 or WSL 2, replacing <Version> with either the number 1 or 2 to represent which version of WSL you would like the installation to default on for new Linux distribution installations. For example, wsl --set-default-version 2

#### Shutdown

`wsl --shutdown`

Immediately terminates all running distributions and the WSL 2 lightweight utility virtual machine. This command may be necessary in instances that require you to restart the WSL 2 virtual machine environment, such as changing memory usage limits or making a change to your .wslconfig file.

#### Terminate

[wsl --terminate <Distribution Name>]()

To terminate the specified distribution, or stop it from running, replace <Distribution Name> with the name of the targeted distribution.

## Unregister or uninstall a Linux distribution

While Linux distributions can be installed through the Microsoft Store, they can't be uninstalled through the store.

To unregister and uninstall a WSL distribution:

```
wsl --unregister <DistributionName>
```

Replacing `<DistributionName>` with the name of your targeted Linux distribution will unregister that distribution from WSL so it can be reinstalled or cleaned up. **Caution:** Once unregistered, all data, settings, and software associated with that distribution will be permanently lost. Reinstalling from the store will install a clean copy of the distribution. For example, `wsl --unregister Ubuntu` would remove Ubuntu from the distributions available in WSL. Running `wsl --list` will reveal that it is no longer listed.

To reinstall, find the distribution in the Microsoft Store and select "Launch".

# Recommended WSL Practices

## Upgrade to WSL 2

​

​
The primary differences between WSL 1 and WSL 2 are the use of an actual Linux kernel inside a managed VM, support for full system call compatibility, and performance across the Linux and Windows operating systems. WSL 2 is the current default version when installing a Linux distribution and uses the latest and greatest in virtualization technology to run a Linux kernel inside of a lightweight utility virtual machine (VM).
