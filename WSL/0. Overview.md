Historically, Windows has not been been the preferred OS for most web developers, but things have changed over the past couple years. Microsoft recently launched Windows Subsystem for Linux or WSL (WSL2), allowing us to install REAL linux distros (like Ubuntu) on Windows 10. 

## This means

1. You can Learn Linux and its more approachable than ever.
2. You can use Linux toolchains (bash, zsh, tmux) and apps to manage the file system and run windows apps.

Developers can access the power of both Windows and Linux at the same time on a Windows machine. 

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

There's no longer a need to restart the system in order to access linux and vice versa.

You can:

- Choose your favorite GNU/Linux distributions [from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore).
- Run common command-line tools such as `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, or other ELF-64 binaries.
- Run Bash shell scripts and GNU/Linux command-line applications including:
  - Tools: vim, emacs, tmux
  - Languages: [NodeJS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2), Javascript, [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/web-frameworks), Ruby, C/C++, C# & F#, Rust, Go, etc.
  - Services: SSHD, [MySQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database), Apache, lighttpd, [MongoDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database), [PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database).
- Install additional software using your own GNU/Linux distribution package manager.
- Invoke Windows applications using a Unix-like command-line shell.
- Invoke GNU/Linux applications on Windows.
- [Run GNU/Linux graphical applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps) integrated directly to your Windows desktop
- [Use GPU acceleration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gpu-compute) for machine learning, data science scenarios and more
