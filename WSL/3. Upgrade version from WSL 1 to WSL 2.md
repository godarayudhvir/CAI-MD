## Upgrade version from WSL 1 to WSL 2

New Linux installations, installed using the `wsl --install` command, will be set to WSL 2 by default.

The `wsl --set-version` command can be used to downgrade from WSL 2 to WSL 1 or to update previously installed Linux distributions from WSL 1 to WSL 2.

To see whether your Linux distribution is set to WSL 1 or WSL 2, use the command: `wsl -l -v`.

To change versions, use the command: `wsl --set-version <distro name> 2` replacing `<distro name>` with the name of the Linux distribution that you want to update. For example, `wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2` will set your Ubuntu 20.04 distribution to use WSL 2.

If you manually installed WSL via Windows Features, you may also need to [enable the virtual machine optional component](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-3---enable-virtual-machine-feature) used by WSL 2 and [install the kernel package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package) if you haven't already done so.

### Recommendation

[Install Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started) ***(Recommended)*** as Windows Terminal supports many command lines that you would like to install and enables you to open them in multiple tabs or window panes and quickly switch between multiple Linux distributions or other command lines (PowerShell, Command Prompt, PowerShell, Azure CLI, etc). You can fully customize your terminal with unique color schemes, font styles, sizes, background images, and custom keyboard shortcuts.
