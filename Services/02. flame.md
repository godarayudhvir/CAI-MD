## Description

Flame is self-hosted startpage for your server. Its design is inspired (heavily) by¬†[SUI](https://github.com/jeroenpardon/sui). Flame is very easy to setup and use. With built-in editors, it allows you to setup your very own application hub in no time - no file editing necessary.

## Functionality

- üìå Pin your favourite items to the homescreen for quick and easy access
- üîç Integrated search bar with local filtering, 11 web search providers and ability to add your own
- üîë Authentication system to protect your settings, apps and bookmarks
- üî® Dozens of options to customize Flame interface to your needs, including support for custom CSS, 15 built-in color themes and custom theme builder
- ‚òÄÔ∏è Weather widget with current temperature, cloud coverage and animated weather status
- üê≥ Docker integration to automatically pick and add apps based on their labels

Create a New flame directory and browse to it

```bash
mkdir -p /home/username/docker/flame

```

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

```bash

services:
  flame:
    image: pawelmalak/flame
    container_name: flame
    volumes:
      - /home/cyberalliance/flame/data:/app/data #change username with your username
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # optional but required for Docker integration
    ports:
      - 80:5005 #change 80 with port you want
    environment:
      - PASSWORD=password4flame
    restart: unless-stopped

## Docker Settings

In order to use the Docker integration, each container must have the following labels:

```yml
labels:
  - flame.type=application # "app" works too
  - flame.name=My container
  - flame.url=https://example.com
  - flame.icon=icon-name # optional, default is "docker"
# - flame.icon=custom to make changes in app. ie: custom icon upload
```

> "Use Docker API" option must be enabled for this to work. You can find it in Settings > Docker

You can also set up different apps in the same label adding¬†`;`¬†between each one.

```yml
labels:
  - flame.type=application
  - flame.name=First App;Second App
  - flame.url=https://example1.com;https://example2.com
  - flame.icon=icon-name1;icon-name2
```

### Adding the labels to existing images

Edit the docker compose file of the desired docker container
and add the labels like below for icon names refer to 
[Material Design Icons - Icon Library - Pictogrammers](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/)

        <link rel="icon" href="/icons/favicon.ico"/>

        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="57x57" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png"/>
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="72x72" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-72x72.png"/>
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="76x76" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-76x76.png"/>
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="114x114" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-114x114.png"/>
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="120x120" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png"/>
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="144x144" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png"/>
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png"/>
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png"/>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"/>
        <meta name="description" content="Flame - self-hosted startpage for your server"/>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/flame.css"/><title>Flame</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.887e49c8.js">

        </script><link href="/static/css/main.289a6408.css" rel="stylesheet">
        </head>
        <body>
            <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
            <div id="root"></div>
        </body>
        </html>
```
