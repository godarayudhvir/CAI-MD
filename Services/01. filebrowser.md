services:
  file-browser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser
    container_name: file-browser
    user: 0:0 #uid and gid
    ports:
      - 2001:80 #Web Gui Will be available on port 8081
    volumes:
      - /:/srv #serves enire server storage
      - /home/username/docker/filebrowser/filebrowser.db:/database.db
      - /mnt/e/Media Libraries:/srv/public/ #windows storage mount

    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
```

This Docker Compose file is used to define and run a service calledÂ `file-browser`Â using Docker. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each line does:

- `services:`: This keyword is used to define the services that make up your app.

- `file-browser:`: This is the name of the service youâ€™re defining.

- `image: filebrowser/filebrowser`: This line tells Docker to use theÂ `filebrowser/filebrowser`Â image from Docker Hub.

- `container_name: file-browser`: This sets the name of the container toÂ `file-browser`.

- `user: 0:0`: This sets the user and group ID for the process inside the container toÂ `0:0`, which corresponds to the root user.

- `ports:`: This keyword is used to expose ports.
  
  - `- 2001:80`: This maps port 80 in the container to port 2001 on the host.

- `volumes:`: This keyword is used to mount paths.
  
  - `- /:/srv`: This mounts the root directory of the host to theÂ `/srv`Â directory in the container.
  - `- /home/username/docker/filebrowser/filebrowser.db:/database.db`: This mounts theÂ `filebrowser.db`Â file from your host toÂ `/database.db`Â in the container.
  - `- /mnt/e/Media Libraries:/srv/public/`: This mounts theÂ `Media Libraries`Â directory from yourÂ `E:`Â drive toÂ `/srv/public/`Â in the container.

- `restart: unless-stopped`: This tells Docker to automatically restart the container if it crashes, unless it was manually stopped.

- `security_opt:`: This keyword is used to modify security options.
  
  - `- no-new-privileges:true`: This prevents the processes in the container from gaining additional privileges.

Create a file "**filebrowser.db**" with "touch"

```bash
touch filebrowser.db
```

Run Docker compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This is the expected output

```
 âœ” Network filebrowser_default  Created                                                          0.2s
 âœ” Container file-browser       Started                                                          0.4s
```

Verify if docker container is running

```bash
docker ps
```

Expected outcome (Stauts healthy and up)

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     COMMAND          CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                                   NAMES

## User Management

#### User default settings

Under Global settings choose the permission you would like to be filled out by default when creating a new user. below is an example of how I like to keep it.

#### Deleting a user account

#### Enabling Self-registration

## User scopes

Under user management and default settings for user you will notice a option called scope. Imagine you want only one folder and its subfolders to be accessible by the new user this is exactly what you need for it.

`/public` will allow new users to only access files in public folder and it's subfolders

Add it to default if required

### Access from outside the network

These are few ways how we can go about doing that

1. If you have a domain name such as example.com
   then you might wanna setup a reverse proxy using
   
   - Nginx Proxy Manager
   
   - [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://github.com/godarayudhvir/shownotes/blob/main/Cloudflare/cf_tunnel.md)
   
   - Traefik
   
   - & More

2. If you don't have a domain name or don't want public accessing it
   setup VPN one of the following services
   
   - Tailscale
   
   - Twingate
   
   - & More
