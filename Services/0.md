### Skills required

## Getting started 🔧

Firstly Create a folder named Docker inside home/username Directory
Inside that create a folder named nameofservice

> This guide presumes the existence of a non-root user on your host. If such a user does not exist, please create one. It is crucial to ensure that this user has the necessary permissions to write data in their user library folder. We frequently establish Docker containers without root privileges for security reasons. Please adhere to these instructions for a successful setup. [Why non-root containers are important for security](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/why-non-root-containers-are-important-for-security)

1. Create a Directory Structure as such
   
   /home/username/docker/nameofservice
   
   `mkdir -p /home/username/docker/nameofservice`

2. Browse into the Directory `cd /home/username/docker/nameofservice`

3. Create a Docker compose file inside the directory `nano docker-compose.yml`

4. Copy and Paste the Docker-compose Template from below.

5. Save the file

```yml

```

### Docker compose breakdown 🧬

### Spinning up 🐳 Docker Container

Run the command `docker compose up -d`

When you execute this command, Docker Compose reads your configuration file, creates and starts the specified services (containers), and detaches them in the background. It’s like bringing your multi-container application to life with a single command!
